<strong>TASKS</strong>

Your tasks are to:

<ul>

 <li>Reorganize your group, re-allocating roles and responsibilities to your members (<strong>your members should be the same as in Assignment 1</strong>)</li>

 <li>Complete the design, implementation and testing of the Warehouse Inventory Management System as specified in the first assignment</li>

 <li>Produce a report detailing the group’s work</li>

</ul>

( Note : for further details on RUP, roles and meetings, please refer to <strong>Appendix A</strong> )

<strong>REPORT</strong>

The submission must include a hard-copy of the report and a CD containing a copy of the report, an executable version of the system, all UML models, source code, and test cases.  In addition, a product demonstration is required during your last lab session.

The report should consists of the following:

<ol>

 <li>A summary of your group’s work on design and implementation. This should cover design artefacts including <strong>architectural design, use cases, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, state diagrams, data persistence and user-interface design</strong>. UML modelling diagrams should be used to illustrate design decisions.</li>

 <li>A brief presentation that illustrates the actual implemented product. This presentation should combine text commentary with information captured from actual execution of programs (as screen shots or as captured text inputs and outputs). This presentation should clarify which of the functional requirements have been successfully implemented.</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>An accurate summary detailing exactly what aspects of the requested functionality are fully implemented in your solution.</li>

</ul>

<ol>

 <li>Details of the construction phase. This part of the report should clarify the work planned and done in each iteration.</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>Summarize the new elements added and the extensions to existing implementation elements. Include brief details of unit testing procedures used to verify new elements prior to their commitment to the project (this does not mean list unit test code and test outputs, simply identify the additional tests created by individual implementers)</li>

 <li>Summarize data from defect and integration reports created by the systems integrator</li>

</ul>

<ol>

 <li>Code</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>Code listings for all elements in the final product should be included in an appendix to the main report</li>

 <li>Samples should be provided of support code such as the unit test classes created to verify particular application classes</li>

</ul>

<ol>

 <li>Testing</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>Test plans, test cases and test reports should be provided</li>

</ul>

<strong>The “meta-report” part should include:</strong>

<ul>

 <li>A tabular summary of the group structure identifying group members, the roles that they filled, the artefacts that they successfully delivered</li>

 <li>Group meeting records and individual diaries:

  <ul>

   <li>There should be a summary detailing the work done at each group meeting</li>

   <li>There should be agendas and reports from all group meetings</li>

   <li>There should be work diaries of all members of the group</li>

  </ul></li>

</ul>

<strong> </strong><strong>DELIVERABLES &amp; SUBMISSION</strong>

Please refer to <strong>Appendix C</strong>.

<strong>MARKING SCHEME</strong>

<ul>

 <li>Overall presentation of report (3 marks)</li>

 <li>Analysis and Design (10 marks)</li>

 <li>Sophistication of the solution (4 marks)</li>

 <li>Project management (4 marks)</li>

</ul>

These marks are based on evidence for the use of an effective software development process. Factors contributing to this part of the assessment will include: evidence for an effective group structure and adoption of roles; effective group collaboration as evidenced by meaningful group meetings; well-planned and disciplined work processes of individuals; and effective use of a versioning system.

<ul>

 <li>Code and testing (5 marks)</li>

</ul>

This part of the assessment will be based on the quality of the implementation code, and evidence for testing such as the unit test code, test cases and test reports. The code should, of course, use properly organized header and implementation files for classes; good coding style is required; elements written by different implementers should be consistent in style (the group should adopt conventions for naming and structuring of code that are used by all implementers).  The code should not contain errors.  Control flow should be well structured.

<ul>

 <li>Product demonstration (4 marks)</li>

</ul>

Individual marks are based on the group mark.  Individual marks are adjusted in accord with the “member’s contribution assessment” document (i.e. “PeerAssess and GrpWrkContributionStmnt.pdf”) submitted by the group. Individual marks <em>cannot</em> be greater than the group mark.

<u>APPENDIX A</u>

( Requirement / Task – Extra info )

<ol>

 <li>The purpose of this assignment is to simulate the RUP approach to software development, starting with the requirements gathering, system analysis and design in Assignment 1, to implementing and testing your system in Assignment 2.</li>

</ol>

Note: for this Assignment, YOU NEED TO IMPLEMENT your system). Your team must also       produce all the necessary artifacts (i.e. code, documents) covering this aspect of your       system development.

<ol>

 <li>In general, your team should undergo (at least):</li>

 <li>a) Inception phase : 1-2 iterations</li>

 <li>b) Elaboration phase : 2-3 iterations</li>

 <li>c) Construction phase : 2-3 iterations</li>

 <li>d) Transition : 1-2 iterations</li>

</ol>

Since this Assignment is mainly focusing on activities from <strong><u>Construction</u></strong> and <strong><u>Transition</u></strong> phases only, the iterations in Inception and Elaboration should be of lower priority

<ol>

 <li>Based on the above, your team should have undergone a total of 3-5 iterations (in Construction + Transition phases). Therefore, the min. no. of:</li>

 <li>a) <strong>formal meeting minutes</strong> should be &gt;= 3 !</li>

 <li>b) <strong>formal work diary</strong> should be &gt;= 3  (for <u>each</u> team member, hence</li>

</ol>

5 team members x 3 = 15 work diaries for the whole team)

<ol>

 <li>As mentioned in Assignment 1 Qn Paper, each meeting minutes should cover the following points / decisions:</li>

 <li>a) Progress status from individual members, who were allocated urgent action                             items in previous meeting [ ‘N’ paragraphs ]</li>

 <li>b) Manager summarizes the overall progress of the entire system [ 1 paragraph ]</li>

 <li>c) Brainstorm and discuss on any un-resolved issues / urgent action items from                          previous meeting [ ‘N’ paragraphs ]</li>

 <li>d) Brainstorm and discuss on the remaining tasks (e.g. research / exploration /</li>

</ol>

development / testing / deployment ) to be done [ ‘N’ paragraphs ]

<ol>

 <li>e) Decide how much time should be allocated to each issue / task [ 1 paragraph                         of bulleted points ]</li>

 <li>f) Allocate tasks to team members [ use a table ]</li>

 <li>g) Decide on the agenda (items/issues to discuss) for the next meeting [ 1                                    paragraph of bulleted points ]</li>

</ol>

Note : the paragraphs in “[ ]” is just a guideline on the format / usual length of the content!

<ol>

 <li>As mentioned in Assignment 1 Qn Paper, each work diary is like a “personal log” that tracks of a team member’s personal progress. The diary should cover the following information:</li>

 <li>a) The start + end date the period covers</li>

 <li>b) What were the list of tasks allocated to you, (should be smiilar to the tasks                               allocated to you in the previous formal meeting)</li>

 <li>c) For each task, discuss the following:</li>

</ol>

–           how much “actual time” you spent on it

–           did you breakdown the task into smaller sub-tasks?

–           are all the sub-tasks completed?

–           which sub-task(s) you faced difficulties, and how do you resolve it?

–           did you discuss your problems with fellow colleagues? What were the                                       remedial actions taken?

<ol>

 <li>The roles required for this group assignment are:</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>Manager (1) – the “Team Leader”</li>

 <li>Lead designer / implementer (1) – probably the same person, but the “lead” role could be split;</li>

 <li>Designer / Implementer / Documentation (many)</li>

 <li>Systems Integration and Testing (1)</li>

</ul>

The designated team leader should take the role of manager or of lead designer /             implementer. Each implementer is responsible for unit testing of his/her code.

<u>APPENDIX B</u>

(Report Details)

<ol>

 <li>A document “<strong><em>A2_Sample_Report_Format.doc</em></strong>” has been provided for you. All teams are to follow its recommendations to organize the contents in a structured manner.</li>

 <li>Another document “<strong><em>SRS_Template.pdf</em></strong> ” has been provided for you. It gives you an idea of the information required produce the Software Requirements Specification. Please adhere to the format and section headings in this template.</li>

</ol>

(Note : the FOCUS of Assignment 2’s SRS should be on the CHANGES (e.g. new       requirements, updates on requirements which were identified in previous assignment, etc)

<ol>

 <li>For all documentation produced, factors like how you communicate your ideas, how you organize your information and the “professionalism” (i.e. overall presentation)  plays an important role in capturing your system’s requirements and design.</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>In order to communicate better in your report, where applicable, you should make use of visual elements like graphs, diagrams, charts, screen-shots, tables, appendices, glossary, etc. to help clarify your ideas</li>

 <li>In order to make your report content more professional and organized, you should have the following in your documents: Cover page, Table of Contents, Formatted document header and/or footer, proper paragraph indentation and alignment, consistent bulleted points, page numbering, etc.</li>

</ul>

<ol>

 <li>During lab session, time will be allocated for each team to demo their system. All teams are to:</li>

</ol>

<ul>

 <li>use power-point slides as the main presentation aid (optional : ‘other’ multi-media elements like video clips, role play, etc)</li>

 <li>ensure all members has “equal exposure” in presentation</li>

 <li>adhere strictly to the allocated time for presentation</li>

</ul>

Note : In Assignment 2 system demo, FOCUS ON:

<ul>

 <li>Explaining the NEW diagrams (e.g. Deployment, Sequence, etc)</li>

 <li>Highlighting the CHANGES (in your systems analysis/design since Assignment 1)</li>

 <li>Doing a product demo</li>

</ul>
